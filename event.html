            <h4>ENFIELD FESTIVAL</h4>
            <button class="but">Know more</button><br><br>
            <p>
                For decades, Royal Enfield has been synonymous with rides across the Himalayas. This December, a first-of-its-kind festival, presented by the Royal Enfield Social Mission, will unfold in the capital. Titled Journeying Across the Himalayas, the 10-day event aims at spotlighting Himalayan art, textile, culture, sport, conservation, architecture, music, and sustainability by way of interactive installations, workshops, culinary experiences, performances, and more.
    
                One of the exhibition’s highlights is Helmeted Hyphae, a six-foot-high structure designed and executed by ST+ART, and it resembles a motorcycle helmet. Constructed from mycelium — an organic material grown through a delicate process that transforms raw, biological matter into a lightweight yet durable form — it is part of the showcase by artist collective Helmets for India (HFI). A part of Royal Enfield’s road safety initiative, HFI promotes road safety and changing mindsets towards safe riding practices. In partnership with India Foundation for the Arts, their exhibit will feature the works of 12 artists using helmets “as a unique and unconventional canvas to express their individuality, emotions, experiences, and perspectives”.
